# California Calling


This project is the culmination of the 4th week of a 6-month full-stack development bootcamp, undertaken after completing the HTML and CSS sections and diving into Sass and SCSS. "California Calling" is a landing page project for which I received a desktop Figma design and had to code the landing page for desktop, tablet, and mobile versions. The project includes the use of flex and grid layouts, position layout, animations, and styling in SCSS format.
